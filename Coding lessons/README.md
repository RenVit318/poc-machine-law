## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### For Adding a New Law:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Analyze legal requirements and complexity
   - Identify required data sources and services
   - Map dependencies to existing laws/services

2. **Implementation Phase**
   ```bash
   # 1. Create service definition (if new service needed)
   touch services/[SERVICE_NAME].yaml
   
   # 2. Create law directory and YAML definition
   mkdir -p law/[law_domain]/
   touch law/[law_domain]/[SERVICE]-[YYYY-MM-DD].yaml
   
   # 3. Create test scenarios
   touch features/[law_name].feature
   
   # 4. Validate and test
   ./script/validate.py
   uv run behave features/[law_name].feature --no-capture -v
   ```

3. **Integration Phase**
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   uv run behave features --no-capture -v
   
   # Code quality checks  
   ruff check && ruff format
   pre-commit run --all-files
   
   # Test web interface
   uv run web/main.py  # Visit http://0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

### Templates Usage:

- **Simple Eligibility Laws**: Focus on YAML requirements section and boolean outputs
- **Complex Calculations**: Use YAML actions with mathematical operations and conditional logic
- **Multi-Service Laws**: Implement cross-service dependencies and comprehensive testing
- **Process-Oriented Laws**: Include workflow state management and appeals processes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Understanding

The system follows this architecture:
```
YAML Law Definitions ‚Üí Python Rules Engine ‚Üí Gherkin Tests ‚Üí Web Interface
         ‚Üì                      ‚Üì                   ‚Üì            ‚Üì
   Legal Logic          Service Integration    BDD Testing   Citizen Access
```

### Key Components:
- **Rules Engine** (`/machine/`): Processes YAML into executable logic
- **Service Layer** (`/machine/service.py`): Orchestrates law evaluation
- **Test Framework** (`/features/`): Validates legal compliance 
- **Web Interface** (`/web/`): Provides citizen access
- **Schema System** (`/schema/`): Ensures structural consistency

## üìä Analysis Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis using specialized subagents, key findings:

### Repository Patterns:
- **10 different Dutch laws** implemented across benefit calculations, eligibility, and tax domains
- **Sophisticated type system** with eurocent precision and temporal specifications
- **Event sourcing architecture** for audit trails and case management
- **Multi-engine support** (Python and Go) with abstraction layers
- **Comprehensive legal traceability** with BWB IDs and article references

### Complexity Levels:
1. **Simple Laws**: Binary eligibility (voting rights) - 2-3 requirements
2. **Medium Laws**: Multi-step calculations (pension age) - 3-4 logic levels  
3. **Complex Laws**: Multi-domain integration (social assistance) - 4-5 levels
4. **Highly Complex**: Advanced calculations (healthcare allowances, tax) - 5+ levels

### Testing Patterns:
- **265 test scenarios** across 10 feature files
- **Multi-source data integration** from 6+ government agencies
- **Comprehensive edge case coverage** including boundary conditions
- **Process flow testing** for appeals and data corrections

## üé® Design Principles

### Legal Accuracy:
- Every field linked to specific legal articles
- BWB IDs and official references required
- Human-readable explanations for complex logic
- Audit trails for all decisions

### Technical Quality:
- Schema validation for all YAML definitions
- Type safety with Pydantic and precise specifications
- Comprehensive error handling with contextual messages
- Performance optimization with caching and dependency resolution

### Maintainability:
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Reusable patterns across different legal domains
- Consistent naming conventions and file organization
- Automated quality checks with pre-commit hooks

## üîß Development Tools

### Required Commands:
```bash
# Testing
uv run behave features --no-capture -v --define log_level=DEBUG

# Validation  
./script/validate.py

# Web interface
uv run web/main.py

# Simulations
uv run simulate.py

# Code quality
ruff check && ruff format
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Dependencies:
- **Python 3.12+** with modern async/await support
- **Behave** for behavior-driven testing
- **FastAPI** for web interface  
- **Pydantic** for data validation
- **Pandas** for data processing
- **Event Sourcing** for audit capabilities

## üìö Learning Path

### For New Developers:
1. Start with `INTEGRATION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` for overview
2. Study existing simple law (e.g., `/law/kieswet/`) 
3. Review corresponding test (e.g., `features/kieswet.feature`)
4. Practice with `YAML_LAW_TEMPLATE.md` for new law
5. Create tests using `GHERKIN_TEST_TEMPLATE.md`
6. Implement steps following `PYTHON_STEPS_GUIDE.md`

### For Legal Experts:
1. Focus on YAML law definition patterns
2. Understand legal basis requirements  
3. Learn test scenario creation for legal validation
4. Practice with simple eligibility laws first

### For Integration Teams:
1. Master the complete workflow process
2. Understand service integration patterns
3. Learn deployment and scaling considerations
4. Focus on quality assurance processes

## üöÄ Future Extensions

These templates are designed to be:
- **Domain Agnostic**: Applicable beyond Dutch law to any legal system
- **Scalable**: Support for complex multi-jurisdictional laws
- **Maintainable**: Clear patterns for long-term sustainability
- **Extensible**: Framework for adding new legal concepts and operations

The analysis and templates provide a solid foundation for transforming legal requirements into reliable, testable, and transparent software systems while maintaining legal accuracy and citizen accessibility.
